# **Refrigerator Haiku**

### Overview

_**Refrigerator Haiku** is inspired by the popular refrigerator magnet game, rendered here in a digital and interactive way. It is an application that serves the user a selection of random words which they can arrange into  a haiku poem.
After completing one round, the user hits a subscription wall in order to get a fresh selection of words for creating another poem._

### MVP

_The **Refrigerator Haiku** MVP offers the user a list of 100 words -- 30 nouns, 30 verbs, 15 adjectives, 15 adverbs, 5 exclamations or interjections and 5 articles or conjuctions -- to select from in formulating a 3 line haiku. The application accepts 5 syllables for the first and last lines and 7 syllables for the middle line. A counter  at each line tracks how many syllables the user has deployed thus far, preventing them from continuing if they surpasse the allowed number of syllables for that line._
