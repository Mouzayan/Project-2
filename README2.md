SWOT Analysis: Heading into project week and with all your planning in mind, consider your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats as they relate to your final project. How will you overcome your weaknesses and threats?
Optionally, include a final section, your Code Showcase. Put snippets you're proud of here, and let your viewers know when you've written brag-worthy code!

For putting wireframes in your ReadMe, we recommend uploading to Imgur, then linking the file directly into your markdown using the ![imageAlt](imageURL) format. The imageURL must be a direct link ending with the file format, such as .png.

In the standups:
What did you work on?
What will you work on?
What's something you expect will block your progress?
What "percent MVP" you are at with your project
